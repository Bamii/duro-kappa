# DURO by team kappa

## problem statement
It is time to move away from people self-organising by writing names on paper and assigning numbers to themselves, to queue up to be attended to.

Customers use Duro to make an appointment and join a virtual queue, all by scanning a QR code or sending SMS to a mobile number when they arrive at the venue. 

They then get assigned a spot on the queue and receive tailored communication (SMS or notifications) to ensure they get in, only when itâ€™s their turn. No more crowded waiting rooms. No more jumping the queue. No more disgruntled customers putting pressure on maxed-out staff.

The QR code and mobile phone number are displayed visibly and outside the premises. The system can be configured for these to change on a routine (e.g daily or hourly), and can use geo-fencing. This way, the business can decide to prohibit people from saving a spot friends until they show up at the premises
