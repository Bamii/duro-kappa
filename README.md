## Description
It is time to move away from people self-organising (by writing names on paper and assigning numbers to themselves) or randomly storming an office, hoping to be attended to.

Customers will use Duro to make an appointment and join a virtual queue, by filling a form, scanning a QR code or sending SMS to a mobile number. 

They then get assigned a spot on the queue and receive tailored communication (SMS or notifications) to ensure they get in, only when itâ€™s their turn. No more crowded waiting rooms. No more jumping the queue. No more disgruntled customers putting pressure on maxed-out staff.

The QR code and mobile phone number are displayed visibly and outside the premises. The system can be configured for these to change on a routine (e.g daily or hourly), and can use geo-fencing. This way, the business can decide to prohibit people from saving a spot friends until they show up at the premises
